# Minishell

Minishell is a simplified version of a Unix shell built in **C** as part of the **42 School curriculum**. The objective of this project is to recreate a command-line interpreter with features like command execution, pipes, redirections, and environment variable handling, providing a deeper understanding of how shells work.

## Project Description

Minishell allows users to run basic Unix commands, handle input/output redirection, and chain commands using pipes, simulating the behavior of a real shell. The project emphasizes system calls, process management, and signal handling, offering a hands-on approach to understanding the inner workings of a shell.

## Features

- Executes basic shell commands.
- Supports piping (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `<`, `>>`).
- Handles environment variables.
- Built-in commands: `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `env`, `exit`, etc.
- Signal handling (e.g., `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`).
